Fortran IV
##########

Back in 1965, I was working as a Cooperative Engineering student at McDonnell Aircraft in St. Louis. I was assigned to the Flight Test Division working on testing the F-$ Phanton II fighter jet in production at the time. A wonderful place for a fledgling Aerospace Engineering student!. My boss offered me a choice for a job he had in mind.During a flight test the jet carried two recording devices. One was an old-fashioned paper roll with a pen tracing a line on the paper. I could sit with a ruler and measure the points along the line so we could analyze the flight data. Or -- I could learn to write a simple program that would read the same data off of a digital recording device that uses magnetic tape to safe the readings. The progrma had to read the tape and generate the needed data.

Let's see - use a ruler and learn nothing much new, or take a shot at this programming thing ans see where that would lead. Little did I know that that one step would end up being a careeeer changing event, but that is another story.

I was handed a Fortran IV manual ans shown to a card punch machine. I spend several days typing in exampe programs, then taking my stack of cards to the computer room where a technician ran then through the machine. I got back a pile of paper tosee what happened. Actually, I was doing what I would do in school in about another year, so I was well ahead of my classmates when that time rolled aroound.

I programmed all through my undergraduate, and graduate education using Fortran, then when I entered the USAF, I continued using that language on bigger and bigger machines, all the way up to a Cray-1 Supercomputer!. The language evolved a bit, but it was the language used by the scientific community in their research work, I eventually got quite good with that language, building some interesting programs, and eventually teaching the language at the Air Force Instutute of TEchnology, the graduate school at Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton Ohio!

Fast Forward
============

I stopped writing major code in Fortran, switching to othe rlanguages, inclusing Pascall, C, Ada, and C++. I also used Python in teaching work as a COMputer Science Professor (see? I did switch careers!)

Upon Retiring from the Air Force, and a second career teaching, I fould myself exploring the new world of Computational FLuid Dynamics, specifically, how thing are now done in the worl od high-performance computing. I was not surprised to find out that Fortran had evolved into a pretty nice machine for high power work, so I set out to explore its new features.
